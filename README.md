# mouse-monster

There are two types of micro:bits in this set up. One is a transmitter. The other is a receiver. The receiver is the "monster mouse" which will seek out the the transmitters. The receiver is attached to a CARL robot and is mobile. The other type are intended to be placed on our grid.

On startup, each type displays Rx if it is a reciever (i.e. the monster mouse) or Tx if it is the transmitter. The grid coordinates for each type have to be input.

Press the A button to begin coordinate entry. When you see the checkmark, you are ready to enter coordinates. Press the B button once for each X coordinate e.g. if your X coordinate is 4 press the B button 4 times. When done entering the X coordinate press the A button to enter the y coordinate. Press the B button once for each Y coordinate e.g. if your Y coordinate is 2 press the B button 2 times. Press the A button again to finish entering coordinates.

On a transmitter micro:bit (no CARL robot attached) shake the micro:bit to have it send it's coordinates. If e/thing is working the Monster Mouse should travel the grid to the transmitter which was just shaken
